# Changelog

All notable changes to BluForge. Newest first.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Native libaacs decryption is now the default.** A disc whose key is in
  `KEYDB.cfg` decrypts and rips with no MakeMKV. MakeMKV's `libmmbd` is used
  only as a fallback (unkeyed disc, or BD+). Force either backend with
  `BLUFORGE_DECRYPT=aacs|mmbd`.
- **Key store:** `bluforge keys add|list|show|remove|import` over `KEYDB.cfg`,
  disc id from `AACS/Unit_Key_RO.inf`, with unit tests. MCP tools `keys_list`,
  `keys_add`, `keys_remove`.
- `bluforge libs` and `bluforge disc` print the chosen decrypt backend; the rip
  logs it with the disc id and keyed flag.
- `docs/decryption.md`: the AACS split, the working setup, the traps, and the
  remaining gap (native AGID drive auth).

### Changed

- Native libaacs cannot read a mounted volume on this stack, so a rip now
  unmounts the disc, reads the raw `/dev/rdiskN`, and remounts afterwards. The
  backend is resolved before the unmount and threaded through nested opens.
- Workspace formatted with `cargo fmt`.
